NNPopObjc is inspired by protocol oriented programming, it provides extensibility for the protocol.

[NNPopObjc 中文文档](README_zh_CN.md)

## Documents

* Read the [NNPopObjc Guide](Doc/1.0.x/usage_en.md) document.

## Quick Start

### Declaring a Procotol

Declaring the Procotol in a `.h` file

```objective-c
@protocol NNDemoProtocol <NSObject>

@optional
- (void)sayHelloPop;
+ (void)sayHelloPop;

@end
```

### Extending the Procotol

Extending the Procotol needs in a `.m` file

```objective-c
///Extending the Procotol for default implemention.
@nn_extension(NNDemoProtocol)

+ (void)sayHelloPop {
    DLog(@"+[%@ %s] code say hello pop", self, sel_getName(_cmd));
}

- (void)sayHelloPop {
    DLog(@"-[%@ %s] code say hello pop", [self class], sel_getName(_cmd));
}

@end
```

### Adopting the Procotol

- Creating a Class

```objective-c
@interface NNDemoObjc : NSObject <NNDemoNameProtocol>

@end
```

- Implementing the Class

```
@implementation NNDemoObjc

@end
```

### Using the Class

- Calling the Methods

```objective-c
[NNDemoObjc sayHelloPop];
[[NNDemoObjc new] sayHelloPop];
```

- Outputting

```objective-c
+[NNDemoObjc sayHelloPop] code say hello pop
-[NNDemoObjc sayHelloPop] code say hello pop
```

## Installation

NNPopObjc supports multiple methods for installing the library in a project.

### Installation with CocoaPods

You can install it with the following command:

```bash
$ gem install cocoapods
```

#### Podfile

To integrate NNPopObjc into your Xcode project using CocoaPods, specify it in your `Podfile`:

```ruby
source 'https://github.com/CocoaPods/Specs.git'
platform :ios, '8.0'

target 'TargetName' do
    pod 'NNPopObjc'
end
```

Then, run the following command:

```bash
pod install
```

#### If installation failed with error：

```bash
[!] Unable to find a specification for `NNPopObjc`
```

try install with the following command:

```bash
pod install --repo-update
```

### Installation with Carthage

[Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) is a decentralized dependency manager that builds your dependencies and provides you with binary frameworks.

You can install Carthage with [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) using the following command:

```bash
$ brew update
$ brew install carthage
```

To integrate NNPopObjc into your Xcode project using Carthage, specify it in your `Cartfile`:

```ogdl
github "amisare/NNPopObjc" ~> 1.0.2
```

Run `carthage` to build the framework and drag the built `NNPopObjc.framework` into your Xcode project.
